                <h3>Plant microbiomes and global change</h3>
                <span class="image left">
                    <img src="images/Research/climatechange.jpg" alt="">
                </span>
                <p>The first major goal of our research is to characterize and quantify the impact of global change on
                    plant-associated microbial communities. While next-generation sequencing has revolutionized our
                    understanding of plant-microbe interactions, there remain critical gaps in understanding how
                    microbiomes might respond to global change. The long-term goal of this research is to understand how
                    pulse disturbances like fire and drought impact the distributions of key microbes. Given the
                    orders-of-magnitude differences between tree and microbial lifespans, differing rates of adaptation
                    and recovery could cause spatio-temporal mismatches between plant and microbe partners. For
                    instance, it is unclear how rapidly microbial communities may adapt, acclimate, or recover from
                    increased frequency of pulse disturbances.
                </p>
                <br>
                
                <h3>Microbial underpinnings of plant community ecology</h3>
                <span class="image left">
                    <img src="images/Research/coexistence.jpg" alt="">
                </span>
                <p>Taking the information that we learn about the impact of global change on microbial distributions, the second major axis of our research
                    program is to understand how the presence of key microbes mediates plant species assembly,
                    especially following severe pulse disturbances. The factors which determine species coexistence and
                    maintain diversity in terrestrial systems is a central question in ecology. One provocative idea is
                    that symbiotic mutualisms control vegetation structure. Leveraging models based on the modern
                    coexistence framework, our research investigates the role of root-associated microbial communities
                    on the resistance and resilience of forest communities to climate change. As climate change poses
                    new challenges for ecosystems, our research will illustrates how microbes influence processes of
                    landscape-scale resistance and resilience.
                </p>
                
                <h3>Microbial drivers of plant physiological ecology</h3>
                <span class="image left">
                    <img src="images/Research/droughtacclim.jpg" alt="">
                </span>
                <p>Using the information that we gain from testing the role of microbes on vegetation dynamics,
                    the last goal of our research program is to determine the role of microbial communities in the
                    physiological resistance of plants to climate change. For instance, AMF are thought to improve plant
                    drought tolerance, yet few studies have demonstrated the potential mechanisms by which drought
                    tolerance could be conferred. Pathogenic microbes may also influence plant ecophysiological
                    responses to climate change. The long-term goal for this component of our research is to determine
                    the role of microbes in the resistance of trees to climate change. Microbiomes are implicitly
                    included in current measurements of plant response to environmental change; however, our predictions
                    are critically limited as it is unclear how much of this variation is driven by microbial
                    interactions or how these interactions might shift with increasing frequency or severity of
                    disturbance. Our research utilizes classical ecophysiological techniques such as stomatal gas
                    exchange and stable isotope ecology to explore novel questions about the role of microbiomes in
                    determining ecophysiological responses of plants to environmental stress.

                <h2>Postdoctoral Researchers and Visiting Scientists</h2>
                <p>Please get in touch if you are interested in collaboratively developing a proposal for a research grant or fellowship. There are many funding opportunities such as the Washington Research Fellows, NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in Biology, Smith Fellowship for postdocs, and Fulbright Scholars for international collaborators. Writing a proposal and funding your postdoctoral research is a fantastic way to increase your competitiveness on the job market.</p>
                
                <h2>Graduate Students</h2>
                <p>Graduate students can join our group through the UW School of Environmental and Forest Sciences (MS or PhD). Funding is usually my limiting factor in taking graduate students, so consideration of potential funding sources will be an important part of your application.</p>
                
                <h3>2024 Update</h3> 
                <p>I currently have no funded grants to support new students, so I am unlikely to admit a student without external funding. Competitive students interested in applying for external fellowships should reach out to me through this <a href="#">interest form</a>.</p>
                
                <h3>Information about Applying to Our Graduate Program</h3>
                
                <h4>Requirements</h4>
                <p>Our MS program averages 2 years and our PhD program averages 5-6 years to graduation. MS students should aim for 1-2 publications by the end of their second year, and a Ph.D. dissertation typically consists of about 3 scientific papers. Program requirements can be found <a href="#">here</a>. To apply for a PhD, an MS is required first, but students can transition directly from MS to PhD upon good standing.</p>
                
                <h4>Funding</h4>
                <p>There are four main options for funding tuition and stipend:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>External Fellowships:</strong> NSF GRFP (for students without an MS), and other potential funding options.</li>
                    <li><strong>Internal Fellowships:</strong> Available through university departments and the larger university.</li>
                    <li><strong>Research Assistantships (RAships):</strong> Funded by advisor grants, subject to grant availability.</li>
                    <li><strong>Teaching Assistantships (TAships):</strong> Limited and not guaranteed but provide teaching experience.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h4>Potential Committee Members</h4>
                <p>Identifying potential committee members within SEFS and UW is important for your graduate program. Your application should include at least two SEFS faculty members as potential committee members.</p>
                
                <h4>My Search Criteria</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Research Fit:</strong> Alignment with lab research, contributions to diversity, and commitment to mentorship.</li>
                    <li><strong>Character:</strong> Self-directed individuals who can formulate scientific questions and overcome challenges.</li>
                    <li><strong>Previous Experience:</strong> Exposure to various aspects of research such as experimental design, data analysis, and writing.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h2>Undergraduate Students</h2>
                <p>If you are interested in forest ecology and would like to join our lab group for undergraduate research experience, please fill out this <a href="#">interest survey</a>. SEFS undergraduates can also explore the <a href="#">Senior Capstone</a> as an option.</p>
