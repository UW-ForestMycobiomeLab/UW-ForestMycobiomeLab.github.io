## A 1-2 sentence description of your research interests

<div>

``` html
<p>
Liv Filialuna, our incredible former lab manager, was instrumental in getting the lab up and running! Their past work includes studying the soil-stabilizing properties of post-fire fungi and creating a digital repository for mycological archives. An active member of the amateur mycology community, Liv volunteers on the North American Mycological Societyâ€™s Vouchering and Marketing committees. Passionate about public outreach, they aim to engage fungal enthusiasts in documenting their history and contributions to mycology.

## 1-2 sentences about your interests outside of lab

<div>

``` html
<p>
They spend their personal time thinking about, playing with, and taking photos of their cats, as well as cross stitching, reading books, and playing DnD.

## Now for your links!

We can link basically any website or profile that you'd like! Ones that
Claire especially recommends are: **ORCID** (good excuse to create this
if you don't have one yet!), **GoogleScholar page** (same!), your
**GitHub profile** (access to your code eventually), and any other
social media (eg **Instagram**, **Bluesky**, **etc**). I highly
encourage you to create a Github webpage of your own, too, as I think
that this can be helpful on the job market!

All you need to do is change out the links here (eg for orcid) to your
own!

<div>

``` html
<!-- The ORCID icon -->
<p>
<li><a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7563-242X" 
class="icon fa-orcid"> ORCID </a></li>

<!-- The GitHub icon -->
<li><a href="https://github.com/mira-ranganath" 
class="icon fa-github"> GitHub </a></li>

<!-- The Instagram icon -->

<li><a href="#" 
class="icon fa-instagram"> Instagram </a></li>
</p>
```

</div>

## And that's it!
