## Welcome to the lab! We are so glad that you are here.

Please add your bio information below so that we can add you to our lab
website!

## Your photo (drop a in image in this [folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1b-t3DPjfUFfXADmTtV-1n9TBSngy8Q6j?usp=sharing))

Please name your photo: firstname.jpg (Claire will add based on the code
below)

<div>

```         
<div class="team-member">
<img src="images/ProfilePics/NAME.jpg" alt="FIRST LASTNAME">
                <div>
```

</div>

## Your name, pronouns, and dates in the lab

<div>

``` html
<h5>
FIRSTNAME LASTNAME (DATE-present)
<small class="pronouns">| they/them</small>
</h5>
```

</div>

## A 1-2 sentence description of your research interests

<div>

``` html
<p>
YOUR NAME is XXXX in the lab whose work is focused on XXXXXX.
</p>
```

</div>

## 1-2 sentences about your interests outside of lab

<div>

``` html
<p>
Outside of the lab, XXXXX
</p>
```

</div>

## Now for your links!

We can link basically any website or profile that you'd like! Ones that
Claire especially recommends are: **ORCID** (good excuse to create this
if you don't have one yet!), **GoogleScholar page** (same!), your
**GitHub profile** (access to your code eventually), and any other
social media (eg **Instagram**, **Bluesky**, **etc**). I highly
encourage you to create a Github webpage of your own, too, as I think
that this can be helpful on the job market!

All you need to do is change out the links here (eg for orcid) to your
own!

<div>

``` html
<!-- The ORCID icon -->
<p>
<li><a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7563-242X" 
class="icon fa-orcid"> ORCID </a></li>

<!-- The GitHub icon -->
<li><a href="https://github.com/" 
class="icon fa-github"> GitHub </a></li>

<!-- The Instagram icon -->

<li><a href="#" 
class="icon fa-instagram"> Instagram </a></li>
</p>
```

</div>

## And that's it!
