## A 1-2 sentence description of your research interests

<div>

``` html
<p>
Suvi is an M.S. student in the lab who's research is focused on utilizing microbial innoculations to improve post-fire regeneration success of giant sequoia seedlings. She is passionate about creating programs to help more Black students enter the field of environmental science, just like the ones that helped her.

## 1-2 sentences about your interests outside of lab

<div>

``` html
<p>
Outside of campus, you can find Suvi hiking, crocheting, admiring trees, or reading with a cup of hot tea on a rainy Seattle afternoon. </p>
```

</div>

## Now for your links!

We can link basically any website or profile that you'd like! Ones that
Claire especially recommends are: **ORCID** (good excuse to create this
if you don't have one yet!), **GoogleScholar page** (same!), your
**GitHub profile** (access to your code eventually), and any other
social media (eg **Instagram**, **Bluesky**, **etc**). I highly
encourage you to create a Github webpage of your own, too, as I think
that this can be helpful on the job market!

All you need to do is change out the links here (eg for orcid) to your
own!

<div>

``` html
<!-- The ORCID icon -->
<p>
<li><a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7563-242X" 
class="icon fa-orcid"> ORCID </a></li>

<!-- The GitHub icon -->
<li><a href="https://github.com/birch33" 
class="icon fa-github"> GitHub </a></li>

<!-- The Instagram icon -->

<li><a href="#" 
class="icon fa-instagram"> Instagram </a></li>
</p>
```

</div>

## And that's it!
